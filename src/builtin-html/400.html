    <p>I'm sure that's a very interesting request you got there!<br/>
    Unfortunately, I have no idea what <em>I'm</em> supposed to do with it. I
    don't even think this is English!</p>
    <p>Look, why don't you take some time off, think about what you were trying
    to say or send. And come back once <strong>you</strong> understand what
    you're trying to say!</p>
